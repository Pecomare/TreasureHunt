<h2>Treasure Hunt</h2>

<i>This is a test project, nothing here is worth forking or copying.</i>

<h3>About</h3>

Treasure Hunt is a console program that:
<ul>
    <li>reads a file</li>
    <li>generates a map from it</li>
    <li>simulates adventurers movements</li>
    <li>exports the results into a file</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>

./TreasureHunt <input_file> <output_file><br/>
./TreasureHunt <input_file><br/>
./TreasureHunt<br/>

If no input_file is specified, then the input file is 'default.in'.<br/>
If no output_file is specified, then the output file is 'default.out'.

<p><i>Note: There could be better ways to represent the model. 
Even if I already refactored it more than once, 
I think that continuing to work on and try improve it would make it 
an eternal project, with improvements everywhere 
and newer versions of .NET bringing their own and thus 
the possibility of having to refactor.</i></p>
